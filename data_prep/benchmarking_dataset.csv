You are given a rectangular 2D numpy array called `arr`, consisting of `m` rows and `n` columns. The array represents a matrix of integers. Your task is to implement a function that horizontally splits the matrix into two or more submatrices.

Write a function called `horizontal_splitter(arr, num_splits)` that takes in the following parameters:
* `arr`: A 2D numpy array of shape `(m, n)`, representing the input matrix.
* `num_splits`: An integer value specifying the number of desired submatrices.

```python

Consider a situation where you are working with data frames in Python using the `pandas` package. You have a specific requirement to remove certain rows or columns from a data frame based on given conditions. To accomplish this task, you need to write a function that drops the required rows or columns from the data frame. Implement a function that takes a data frame and the relevant parameters as input, and returns a modified data frame with the specified rows or columns removed.

Write a Python function that performs the aforementioned task. Make sure to adhere to the following specifications:

- The function should have the following signature: `def drop_rows_cols(data_frame, condition, axis=0)`.
- The `data_frame` parameter represents the input data frame that needs to be modified.
- The `condition` parameter determines the criteria based on which you decide which rows or columns to drop. This condition can be expressed as a lambda function that takes a row or column as input and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether it satisfies the condition or not.
- The `axis` parameter is an optional argument that specifies whether you want to remove rows or columns. By default, its value is set to `0`, indicating that it will drop rows. If a value of `1` is passed, it should drop columns instead.

Your task is to implement the function `drop_rows_cols` based on the given requirements. Remember to use the `pandas` package to achieve the desired functionality. Test your function on various data frames and conditions to ensure its correctness.

**Note:** Avoid using any in-built functions or methods that directly solve the problem, as the goal is to implement this functionality manually.",hard,moderately,common

```python
def remove_rows_or_columns(data: pandas.DataFrame, axis: str, conditions: dict) -> pandas.DataFrame:
    pass
```
The `data` parameter represents the input DataFrame. The `axis` parameter should specify whether rows or columns need to be removed. If `axis` is set to `'rows'`, the function should remove rows that meet the conditions specified in the `conditions` dictionary. If `axis` is set to `'columns'`, the function should remove columns meeting the conditions.

The `conditions` dictionary will have column names as keys and corresponding conditions as values. For rows, each condition should be a lambda function which takes a row as input and returns `True` if the row should be removed, or `False` if it should be kept. For columns, each condition should be a lambda function which takes a column as input and returns `True` if the column should be removed, or `False` if it should be kept.

Here's an example of how the function should work:
```python
data = pandas.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]})
